//! The Zed side of Versions-LE.
//!
//! This crate holds no extraction logic. It resolves `versions-le-mcp` from npm and
//! hands Zed a command that launches it over stdio — the same server the VSIX
//! bundles and the same one `npx versions-le-mcp` runs. Keeping it a launcher is
//! deliberate: a second implementation in Rust would be a second set of
//! behaviour to keep in agreement with the goldens.
