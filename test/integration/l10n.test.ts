/**
 * Guards the two localization mechanisms, which are separate and fail
 * separately:
 *
 *   package.nls.<locale>.json      -> manifest strings (%key% in package.json)
 *   l10n/bundle.l10n.<locale>.json -> runtime strings (vscode.l10n.t)
 *
 * This is the regression test the v1.x line did not have. Back then
 * `vscode-nls` was misconfigured (`nls.config(...)()` called without
 * `__filename`), so every runtime string silently fell back to English while
 * thirteen fully-populated catalogues sat in the VSIX looking perfectly
 * correct. Shipping catalogues and rendering translations are different
 * things, and only the second is worth anything to a user.
 *
 * Note on what cannot be asserted here: `vscode.l10n` is scoped to the
 * extension whose code calls it. Test code runs under the test runner's
 * identity, so `vscode.l10n.t('URLs-LE: Ready')` in this file resolves against
 * the runner's (empty) bundle and returns English even on a German host —
 * regardless of whether this extension's own localization works. Asserting
 * German here would only ever test the harness. Verified manually instead: on a
 * host launched with `--locale=de` and the German language pack installed, this
 * extension's activate() reports `lang=de ready="URLs-LE: Bereit"
 * bundle=LOADED`. What this file guards is that the catalogues shipped
 * alongside that mechanism stay correct and complete.
